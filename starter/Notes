Running `npm run build` without lazy loading, these files are in dist/assets:
    index-0a7524cc.css
    index-f2b6ea52.js -> initially 145B
Running `npm run build` with lazy loading, these files are in dist/assets:
    index-1ccc7021.js -> still 145B
    index-b9c1cbff.css
    Order-338cb004.css
    Order-e17cd674.js
    Orders-9eaf0f6e.js
    Orders-f43fc386.css
This is now 3 JS/CSS bundles - 1 for normal, 1 for Orders, 1 for Order.
For lazy loading to Work, the imported component must be the default export!
Rendering lazy components fine but not noticing differences in bundle size.
With 3G throttling, home is super slow to load. I can see loading... message at orders tab.
